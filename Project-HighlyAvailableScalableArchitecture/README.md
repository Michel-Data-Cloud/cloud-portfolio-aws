# Highly Available & Scalable Architecture

## Overview
In this project, I designed and deployed a highly available architecture using AWS services such as EC2, ALB, RDS, and Auto Scaling to ensure application scalability and fault tolerance.

## Key Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2** for compute capacity
- **AWS RDS** for database
- **AWS ALB** for load balancing
- **Auto Scaling** for scalability
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring and alerting

## Challenges
- Ensuring **high availability** and **fault tolerance** with minimum downtime
- Managing **scaling** for varying loads

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Terraform configuration to provision the infrastructure.
3. Access the EC2 instances behind the load balancer.
