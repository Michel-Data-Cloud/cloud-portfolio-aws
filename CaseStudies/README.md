# Case Studies Portfolio

Welcome to my **Case Studies Portfolio**!

This folder contains a collection of technical projects that showcase my skills in cloud architecture, software development, and infrastructure automation. Each case study represents a real-world problem I solved using **AWS** and **Terraform** (with some projects involving Python, Flask, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines).

## Projects Included:

- **Project-HighlyAvailableScalableArchitecture**  
  A highly available, auto-scaling web application built on AWS using EC2, RDS, Auto Scaling, and Terraform.

## About the Case Studies

Each case study is structured with the following:
1. **Problem Statement** - What was the challenge or business need?
2. **Solution** - How did I approach solving the problem?
3. **Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of the solution.
4. **Technologies Used** - A list of technologies involved (AWS services, tools, languages, etc.).
5. **Cost Estimation** - Approximate cost of the solution for different scenarios.
6. **Security Considerations** - Measures taken to ensure a secure solution.
7. **Performance Testing** - Results of any performance tests (e.g., load tests).
8. **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways from each project.

Feel free to explore the individual projects to understand the scope of the work and the depth of the architecture. I am continuously updating and improving these case studies as I gain more experience and complete more projects.
